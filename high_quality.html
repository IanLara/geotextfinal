              <p>•Our Surface Logging Services team reliably and accurately monitors, analyzes, and integrates real-time geological drilling data.
              </p>

              <p>•The services includes lithology, mineralogy, presence of oil, and formation gases</p>

              <p>• The goal is to help you evaluate formations, identify ways to combat wellbore instability, improve hole cleaning, prevent stuck pipe, optimize wellbore construction, and enhance drilling performance. 
              </p>

              <p>• The real value in Geotex Surface Logging Service is the ability to predict the probability of drilling events that could have harmful results, enabling you to avoid them altogether. </p>

        <p> <span class="font-weight-bold">We provide an extensive array of monitoring and analysis technology and services, including:</span> 
          <br>
          <br>

      •Geologic services <br>
      •Gas monitoring and analysis <br>
      •Fluids monitoring <br>
      •Operations monitoring <br>

      <br>

        Geotex Surface Logging seamlessly integrates the data it acquires with data collected using directional drilling, logging while drilling, measurement while drilling, wireline, and third-party services. Around-the-clock monitoring and analysis of all operational parameters assure successful well placement while reducing nonproductive time and providing a safe working environment.
        <br>
        <br>

          <span class="font-weight-bold">Proactive interpretation of data:</span> <br><br>

          We have the depth and range of knowledge needed to recognize potential drilling and production problems before they occur. By combining high-quality data, expert interpretation, and predictive analytics, we have the tools to reduce the risk of incidents and improve the performance of your wells in every drilling environment. <br><br>

          We monitor the drilling operations at the wellsite and from remote operation centers to look for changes in data trends, such as a variation in torque, pump pressure, any changes in penetration rate, or an increase in gas levels. If changes occur, the Geotex Surface Logging personnel will notify you immediately. In addition, the TLog control  real-time remote collaboration platform provides 24/7 access to your data with our family of TControl data delivery services.<br><br>

          Geofield Surface Logging Services mudlogs plotting software offers a full range of customizable geological plotting solutions, including measured and horizontal lagged depth logs.<br><br>

          Horizontal and vertical display formats and 1, 2 and 5 inch log scales. We have numerous software data options to provide you the data you want, when you need it, in the format you require.<br><br>
